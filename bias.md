# Bias

# Welcome to class 9

The next two classes will be about bias and fairness. First we'll talk about how AI systems become biased. We will look at this through a variety of lenses to get a broad view. We will examine both case studies of popular cases and more academic audits. This week we'll focus on understanding bias. We'll get specific about what it means for an AI system to be biased and how AI systems produce biased decisions.
